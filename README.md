## Why this Project Exists

I created this projec t because I have never found a book tracking application that fully matrches the experience, flexibility, and level of insight I want as a reader. Most existing apps feel limited in customization, lack meaningful progress tracking, or do not provide a clean, modern user experience across boith web and mobile platforms. 

This project is an opportunity to design and build a book tracker from the ground up with a focus on:

- Clean, intuitive user experience
- Reliable cross-platform syncing between web and mobile
- Offline-first mobile functionality 
- Scalable backend architecture
- Full ownership of both product design and technical implementation

In addition to solving a real personal need, this project serves as a production-grade full-stack application to deepen expertise in backend architecture, mobile development, database design, and scalable system design.
